I am majoring in MIS because it is what interests me and keeps me wanting to learn more and to keep getting better. 2 years ago in my freshman year I was a stressed out computer science major who did not know what they were getting into. At the end of that year I decided to change majors to something that caught my eye much more yet it was similar to what I was leaving. MIS brings the real world aspects of ICS much faster personally, and I really enjoy that because it reassures that what we are doing in class will help me in my future.
