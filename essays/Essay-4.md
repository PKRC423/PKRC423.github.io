1. My Programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:

  Before this class I took 1 other coding class my freshman year where at the end of the year we created our own games, large project and other things. I wish I better retained that information from then because It would have been a great help in this class. But as this course has gone on I slowly remembered some things but not much. As we went along I did not take the class as serious as I should have and that quickly kicked me in butt and made me change that view. Once I started studying more for this class than my others I understood it better (I don't have much time in my day outside of classes and work to study). But looking back I have greatly improved. I understand many ways how each language can be correctly utilized to create a simple webserver. And I have greatly improved my effectiveness and efficiency in creating one and the individual building blocks of the server. And I now can recognize different code languages from one another and can interpret their contents much better.
  
2. I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

  Practicing "Skills"
  Creating different types of pages with the application given to us
  Remembering the base and basic coding terms for each language so I can speed the building process up.
  
3. I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first.

    I need to attempt the WOD multiple times before getting it right still. I need to practice more but I don't have the time to study and do work for all my classes and repeat the same code over again to remember it instead of seeing real examples of it being used. And maybe I should have studied for a little after my first attempt and then tried again, and after the second attempt watch the screencast. I say this because reflecting on it I relied on the screencast more than I'd like. But nearing the last WOD I was more confident since I understood it better since it was less tags/building and more functionality. 


4. The Labs have helped me to learn, and I am able to complete them with confidence.

    The Labs have helped me see what we are focusing on that week does in the context we do in lab. But at many points it was hard to connect the reasoning or real purpose of each part with one another until the Forms lesson and Assignment 1. I can now see where each part can be utilized but during most of the Labs I was not fully confident I could finish the entire thing on my own without the lab.

5.I feel like I have the resources needed to complete this task but still not as well prepared as I should be and very time constricted since we have 1 week less to complete this. But for the future stage of programming, I feel if I put more time into this and practiced more then I would feel much more confident and capable of building small web applications.

6.I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

    I know it would be harder projects, but I feel like making more "appealing" pages that look good and aren’t bare bones would interest and make the work better. Maybe if when we learned about CSS we learned more about the templates, and then for the WOD and labs we used the templates. Personally, this would have made it a lot more engaging and interesting than bare bone things that awkwardly fit a screen. I also think showing the functions and such being used in more complex and complete pages that it would make more sense to us.

7.These are the things that worked well for my learning during this class so far:
   
   For the WODs, the screencasts were helpful, besides some of them were done slightly differently than what the instructions say. It was not a big inconvenience though since they helped me with what order to create these "applications" for future reference.
   
   I think W3 is tremendous, and I can't believe it’s free. I will use it forever probably.
   
   And I think repetition helped a lot more with this type of work. To really understand this subject as "fluently as possible" I would need to practice this every day, and with a full class schedule and working a lot, it was very difficult to find time to practice the work.
