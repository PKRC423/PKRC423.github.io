    In Browser History 6, we were tasked to upgrade our browser history html page again. This time we had to make each column its own page for their repsective browser, then change the navbar so thast instead of there being links that send the user to each browsers download site but buttons that lead to the new html pages we created. We also had to make the logo of the respective browser appear when the mouse moves over it's button. And then we had to change some of the styling aspects of the pages to correctly complete the task. When first approaching this assignment I was not too worried about it as the previous ones, mainly because it seemed shorter than the others. When I was first reading over the instructions I had to go to W3schools a couple of times to reassure I knew what I was going to do to execute this WOD correctly.
    
    On my first attempt I was going well but I started having diffculties with the CSS part of the assignment. I spent more time on this part than expected which made me have to do the WOD again. I had troubles formatting each browser page seperatley from the main "index" doc I had. After my first attempt I went back to W3 to go over what I missed and also watched the screencast to see how professor port did it. After watching it, I realized I overcomplicated my code way more than needed. I also realized it would be much easier with two separate CSS style sheets, one for the index page and another for the browser pages. 
    
    After some more studying and preparing for this second attempt I felt ready to attempt it again. On this run it was much more streamline and felt better and more assured that what I was doing was correct and would work. My second run ended much better with an ADV time. I think overall I still need to study the languages better so I can remember the tags, I understand the logic and how its formatted I just never can remember all of the tags needed unless I study them recently before my attempts. My goal is to imprint the languages into my head so I don't forget them so easily.
