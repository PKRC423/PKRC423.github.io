E6 Reflection Paper
*Written before my assignment was finished since we were given the generous extension on my assignment*
Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)
Our system is an online store for selling merchandise and tickets for the UH Manoa Athletics events. For now it would just sell simple tops, bottoms, accessories and model tickets.
Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
Our major shortcoming was not finishing the project “on-time”. Due to flooding at my house I was not able to work on this project for multiple days. But thanks to professor Kazman we were given a very generous extension to finish the project.
Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
What I am most proud of in our system was our ability to work through the difficulties and create a workinging site and our progress as students and MIS students. In our program I really liked our CSS and how our page looks, at least now. We hope that after our reformatting that our pages will look the same or better.
Describe what you are least happy with your system:
What I am least happy with our system was how difficult we made it, as in we took a more difficult and less known path to complete this assignment. We made it harder on ourselves when starting assignment 2 which in turn delayed our progress for assignment 3. But our ability to adapt to this was our turning point and where we showed our real improvement personally. 
How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
Developing this assignment was much different than assignment 2, since we decided to reformat our assignment. We chose to change the way our pages loaded, from attempting to make multiple pages by actually creating multiple pages instead of running the users choice through a function to create a page.
When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
We learned from assignment 2 how to much better approach these situations. We made use of our github in a much more efficient way. When we worked together one would have the old code loaded and the other would be editing and changing the code. When we ran into an unknown error we would look back at the old code and see what I changed.
Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
During this assignment our debugging skills and problem solving skills were much improved. We learned our lesson of having poor debugging and recognition of issues within our program. Throughout this assignment we correctly referenced back to our old code and realized where certain errors came from.
Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
Unfortunately, what did not work well was our implementation of the Assignment 3 code into our program. We tried several ways and different attempts but we could not figure out how to make the multiple pages or sessions properly work until we decided to change our format of our program to easier implement the new code for the tasks.
What did you learn from doing this assignment?
From this assignment overall, I learned that hard-work does not make progress without smart-work. In assignment 2, I would spend hours on end trying to figure out an issue that took me 10mins to solve in assignment 3. I would blindly try changing parts thinking the issue was there but when I learned how to better debug and fix my problems I started to work smarter. 
If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
If I could go back in time and change multiple things to my project I would. First thing would be the way I loaded the pages. Instead of using templates and making it much harder for me to implement the code for assignments 2 and 3. I would also use comments and console logs more so my code was better organized and structured from the beginning. 
Estimate the % of time you spent
(a) thinking about how to do something; 40%
(b) writing code (but do not include testing; 25%
(c) testing and debugging; 35%
Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)
Peter; 50%
Nate; 50%
For most of the project Nate and I aimed to work together whenever possible so we both understood what the other was doing to the program. But nearing the end of the semester I had flooding in my apartment and I had multiple days where I could not work on the project due to this. But luckily Nate was able to still work on it in my absence. After I had things sorted out I was able to get back to work and help with finishing the project. We both worked together and on our own but we both worked on almost everything together.
